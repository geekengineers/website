# Data-Oriented Parser Design with Token Streams

When parsing, a common way to handle tokens is to use a central, mutable state. For example, in many recursive-descent or LL parsers, a shared pointer tracks the current token and the lookahead token. Parsing functions then use methods like nextToken() or access global fields to advance this pointer through a list of tokens.
This object-oriented approach can get complex. Functions become reliant on this hidden, mutable state, and handling lookahead or backtracking often requires manually resetting pointers. This can lead to bugs, especially if parsing fails and the state needs to be rewound.
A data-oriented approach is different. It views the input as an immutable stream of tokens. Instead of a global index, a parser is given an explicit token iterator (or generator) from which it pulls tokens as needed. Each parsing function takes this iterator, consumes tokens from it, and returns the remaining iterator to the calling function. The original token list or buffer is never modified; only the iterator's position advances. This makes the parser's logic simpler and more predictable.

## Traditional vs Stream-Based Token Handling

- Traditional Approach: In the traditional approach, a parser typically uses a shared, central state to manage the token stream. This often involves a mutable object or a class field that tracks the current and next tokens. Every parsing function relies on this shared state, calling methods like advanceToken() or peek() to move through the tokens. A key issue with this method is that lookahead and backtracking become complex; they require extra logic to save and restore this shared state, which can lead to convoluted and bug-prone code.

- Iterator/Stream Approach: The iterator or stream-based approach is a more elegant, pull-based design. The lexer generates a token stream object that adheres to a standard interface, such as a Python generator or Java's {"Iterator<Token>"}. The parser simply calls a method like next() to pull one token at a time from this stream. This design is inherently more robust because it avoids a global, mutable state. The parser holds its own local iterator and advances it as needed, making the logic simpler and more predictable. This is a common pattern in pull-based parsing.

Using a stream-based approach to parsing means the original input data remains immutable. Rather than a parser writing to global fields, each parsing function receives an {"Iterator<Token>"} or a reference to a token stream as its input.
This function then reads the tokens it needs, perhaps buffering one or two for lookahead, before returning the updated iterator. The tokens themselves and the underlying list they belong to stay unchanged. This design is more data-centric; you feed the data (the token stream) into the parser, instead of the parser manipulating a shared, global state.
Lexers and interceptors act as iterators that produce streams of tokens, and the parser queries these tokenizers for the next token. Essentially, the parser's methods consume tokens from an {"Iterator<Token>"} instead of relying on an external mutable pointer.

## Benefits of a Data-Oriented Token Stream

1. **On-Demand Parsing**

This method only retrieves tokens when the parser actually needs them. If a parsing error occurs early on, the parser might not even consume the entire token list. This on-demand behavior is a big plus for performance and error handling with large inputs, as the process stops as soon as an error is found. This saves time and resources, making the parser more efficient.

2. **Simplicity and Clarity**

By explicitly passing an iterator, the flow of data becomes obvious. The input and output for each function are clear, which reduces hidden side effects and makes the code easier to follow. This design also promotes modularity and code reuse, as parsers are written as functions that take a token stream as a parameter instead of implicitly relying on a global state. This approach works well with functional programming styles, where functions return both a result and the remaining tokens.

3. **Lookahead and Backtracking**

Since the token sequence is not altered, implementing lookahead or speculative parsing becomes much simpler. You can easily clone or buffer the iterator to peek ahead without changing the main stream, or even push tokens back if a parsing branch fails. In contrast, with a single global token pointer, you'd have to manually save and restore indices to backtrack, which is often a source of bugs. Many modern parser generators and libraries use this stream-based approach to enable natural backtracking and multi-token lookahead.

4. **Statelessness and Concurrency**

When a parser doesn't touch shared state, the design is inherently thread-safe and easier to test. This means you could parse different parts of an input simultaneously, each with its own iterator, without worrying about race conditions. This stateless approach is also a great fit for languages that favor immutability.

5. **Performance**

A data-oriented design can lead to more cache-friendly memory layouts. For example, storing parse results in arrays instead of a tree of objects can significantly improve performance. One case study showed that a data-oriented parser stored data in parallel vectors, which meant unrelated data (like comments) were kept separate and weren't loaded unless needed. This reduced memory and cache usage, leading to a parser that used about 12% less memory and ran slightly faster than a conventional implementation. While this is about how the data is stored after parsing, it highlights how thinking about contiguous data can lead to real speed and size benefits.

## Stream-based token handling can simplify grammar disambiguation, a notoriously difficult problem in parsing.

Languages often have ambiguous grammar, where the same sequence of tokens can be interpreted in more than one way. Examples include the "dangling else" problem or C++'s use of >> for both bit-shifting and nested templates. With a token iterator, you can try one parsing path and, if it fails, simply rewind the iterator or use a fresh copy to try another. Because the input data is immutable, this process is non-destructiveâ€”you don't alter the original token list.
Similarly, context-sensitive lexing (deciding how to tokenize based on the surrounding code) becomes easier. You can peek ahead in the stream to make a decision, like whether >> should be treated as a single token or two separate ones. By giving each parsing function its own "slice" of the token data through an iterator, you avoid corrupting the main token list while making these critical decisions. This significantly reduces the complex code needed for disambiguation, as tokens can be queried, buffered, or returned without any need for a global rollback system.

# Implementation Guidelines

## Use a Stream Interface

Your lexer should produce an object that acts like a stream or iterator. This object should have a simple method, like next(), that returns the next token. In languages like Java or C#, this might be an {"Iterator<Token>"}. In Python, you'd use a generator. The core idea is that your parser calls this interface to pull tokens, rather than relying on a shared, global pointer.

## Provide Peek and buffering

Many parsers need to look ahead one or more tokens to decide what to do next. You can implement a peek() method using a small internal buffer. When peek() is called, it can store the next token in a buffer without consuming it from the main stream. The next() method would then return this buffered token first before getting a new one from the stream. This ensures that peeking doesn't change your position in the stream.

## Avoid Global State

Do not use global or class fields to store the current token or index. Any state needed for parsing should be local to the function or passed explicitly as an argument. Each parsing function should take an iterator, use it, and then return the updated iterator for the next step. This makes functions reusable, free of side effects, and easier to test.

## Handle Errors Gracefully

When an error occurs, a stream-based parser simply stops consuming tokens. Because the underlying stream is intact, it's easy to report the location of the error since the stream hasn't moved past that point. Your parser function can catch the mismatch and return a failure without affecting the rest of the stream, making debugging much more straightforward.

## Think About the Big Picture

This approach works well with parser combinators and parser generators. Many of these tools are built on the principle of advancing a token stream, and this model fits perfectly with their design.

Ultimately, your focus should be on data flow. Think of your parser as a series of transformations: the raw token stream goes in, and a syntax tree comes out. By using an explicit iterator to "pull" tokens, you make your parser more modular, readable, and easier to reason about.

# Case Study: Token Interception Pattern

n this design, the parser is an object that simply pulls tokens from an iterator. As described by Van Wyk et al., "tokenizers are assumed to be a kind of iterators that produce streams of tokens," and parsers "query tokenizers for the next token."

An interceptor can even be used to wrap the token iterator to handle specific tokens differently, such as embedding another parser to handle a different syntax. The key is that the parser never interacts with or modifies a global token list; it only calls next() on its iterator. This lazy, demand-driven style makes it easy to implement special cases like embedded syntaxes or macros as filters on the token stream, all without complex global state. This is a form of "lazy, demand-driven, or stream-like programming" of token streams.

# Conclusion

This approach leads to much cleaner and more maintainable code. Instead of relying on a single, shared state like a global current_token, you feed the parser an {"Iterator<Token>"}. This makes every step of consuming a token explicit and self-contained.
